💳 Credit Card Fraud Detector
A multilingual Streamlit web application that detects potential credit card fraud with AI-powered predictions, live currency conversion, flexible time units, and multi-language support. The model is trained on real transaction data to identify fraudulent activity with high accuracy.

📄 Overview
This project uses a Logistic Regression model trained on a credit card transactions dataset. It supports English, Arabic, Spanish, French, and Japanese interfaces, allowing users to input transaction amount, time since the last transaction, and currency. The app predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent and displays confidence levels, risk categories, and a downloadable audit history.

✨ Features
🌍 Multilingual Support – English, Arabic (RTL), Spanish, French, Japanese.

💱 Live Currency Conversion – USD, SAR, EUR, GBP, JPY (auto-updated rates).

⏳ Flexible Time Units – Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years.

🔍 Hybrid Risk Detection – Model probability + rule-based checks.

📊 Confidence Meter – Low, Medium, High risk display.

🗂 Audit-Friendly Logs – Transaction check history downloadable as CSV.

🕌 RTL Layout – Arabic UI adapts automatically.

🧠 Machine Learning Details
The model is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

Handles imbalanced classes with class weighting.

Scaler applied to normalize features.

Custom percentile-based high-amount alerts.

Outputs fraud probability score for better interpretability.
